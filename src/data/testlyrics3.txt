[Verse 1]

                          C     Am

Ever since I left the city you

                      Em

Got a reputation for yourself now

                         C          Am

Everybody knows and I feel left out

                                  Em

Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out

                                  C     Am

Cause ever since I left the city, you

                             Em

Started wearing less and goin' out more

                              C             Am

Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor

                                  Em

Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Verse 2]

                          C               Am

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you

                         Em

You and me we just don't get along

                        C             Am

You make me feel like I did you wrong

                         Em

Going places where you don't belong

                           C      Am

Ever since I left the city, you

                          Em

You got exactly what you asked for

                               C       Am

Running out of pages in your passport

                                    Em

Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

[Verse 3]



These days, all I do is

C                             Am

Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else

C                             Am

Wonder if you rolling up a backwoods for someone else

C                                   Am

Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else

Em

You don't need no one else

Em                           C

You don't need nobody else, no

                Am

Why you never alone

                        C

Why you always touching road

                        Am

Used to always stay at home, be a good girl

                Em

You was in the zone

                   Em

You should just be yourself

                           Em

Right now, you're someone else
