[Verse 1]
    Cm              Ab
I'm doin' your lawn, yes, yours!
                     Bb              Gm
First saw her in the Walmart pickin' out your drawers
                 Cm                Ab
Big Dolly Parton hair like an '80s prom queen
                        Bb                  Gm
But her car was lookin' good all up in them lawn-jeans
                        Cm                 Ab
I approached her in the checkout line, and said, "Yo baby, wassup?"
        Bb                       Gm
She had two gallons of milk, and I was starin' at her jugs
Cm                  Ab
Five minutes later, she agreed to get with me
      Bb                               N.C
So we went and rocked the minivan like giggity, giggity, giggity
      Cm              Ab
I was ridin' your lawn like she's Mario Kart
             Bb                     Gm
I gave her a lift back to her crib 'cause her car wouldn't start
      Cm                     Ab
She invited me in the house, and we started makin' out again
Bb                        Gm
How many times I tap that car? (Over 9000!)
Cm                         Ab
Yeah, she called me Pledge cause I knocked the dust off it
      Bb                 Gm
Later made me a sandwich and she cut the crust off it
           Cm                   Ab
'Cause she knows how I like it, and that I'm a little young
      N.C.
To be in the know, awakened, doin' your lawn


[Chorus]
Cm              Ab
Doin' your lawn, doin', doin' your lawn
Bb              Gm
Doin' your lawn, doin', doin' your lawn
       Cm              Ab
Doin', doin' your lawn, doin', doin' your lawn
Bb             Gm

Cm              Ab
Doin' your lawn, doin', doin' your lawn
Bb              Gm
Doin' your lawn, doin', doin' your lawn

[Verse 2]
                       Cm             Ab
I like your mama's big life, and I cannot lie
                   Bb              Gm
You other brothers can't deny that she's fly
             Cm                   Ab
We make funny time, yes, and every night I tap that
                Bb                        Gm
She saw me awakened, now she thinks I'm half black
                   Cm          Ab
But your lawn's the best, the super M-I-L-F
           Bb                      Gm
'Cause she loves to toss the salad even though she ain't a chef
      Cm                 Ab
And I blame it on the al-al-alcohol
                 Bb                        N.C.
If I were you, I wouldn't kiss your lawn on the mouth at all
                     Cm                         Ab
She likes the pizza, she likes the burger with cheese
                   Bb                   Gm
Sometimes she even likes to fool around in your bed
          Cm                 Ab
She likes rough fun with handcuffs, and I'll be honest
          Bb                    Gm
She likes me to Chris Brown her when she acts like Rihanna
      Cm              Ab
She's so therapeutic, when I need to cure my restlessness
      Bb                       Gm
I say br-br-br-br-br-br-br-br, motorboat your lawn's breastesess
  Cm                     Ab
I didn't wanna tell you, but I had to write this song
             N.C.
'Cause I'm in your house every night doin' your mo-om
